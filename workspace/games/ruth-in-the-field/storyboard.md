# Ruth in the Field of Boaz

## 1. Premise

This is a collector game about Ruth's faithfulness and costly belonging (Ruth 1–2). Set on the harvest roads between Moab and Bethlehem, it is built for a youth-group player who has been taught that loyalty is sentimental — and walks away knowing it is sacrificial. The player moves through four scenes as Ruth: choosing to stay with Naomi, arriving as a stranger, gleaning what the harvesters leave behind, and receiving a place she did not earn. The game ends not with a trophy but with a meal shared between strangers who chose each other.

## 2. Persona

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `whyTheyPlay` | To feel what it means to stay when leaving would have been easier |
| `whatTheyNeedFromGame` | The weight of a choice that costs something real |
| `whatBreaksImmersion` | Violence, mockery of Naomi's grief, countdown pressure, a forced "correct" theological answer |
| `background` | Youth group (ages 13–17), familiar with the story's surface but not its emotional depth |
| `location` | Ancient Near East — Moabite road and Bethlehem barley fields |

Approved 2026-06-22. "The emotional arc is right — especially the 'belonging without earning' framing for SB-004. Keep it."
